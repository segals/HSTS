# HSTS — change log

Running record of every meaningful change: **what** changed, **why**, and **how**.
Kept so the project can be explained and defended at the demo.

## Milestone 1 — walking skeleton · 2026-07-29

**Goal:** prove that JavaFX + OCSF + MySQL + fat-jar packaging all work together
on JDK 26 *before* writing a single feature. No HSTS functionality is included
on purpose.

### What was built

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Four Maven modules | `hsts-ocsf`, `hsts-common`, `hsts-server`, `hsts-client` |
| `G1_Server.jar` (14.3 MB), `G1_Client.jar` (9.7 MB) | Names required by the Assignment 3 instructions |
| Server startup window + console screen | FXML; מתווה item 15 |
| Client startup window + skeleton check screen | FXML; מתווה item 15 |
| `Request` / `Response` / `Credentials` protocol envelope | Shared by both jars |
| `PasswordHasher` | Salted SHA-256 |
| `DBController` (Singleton) | Creates the database if absent |
| `HSTSServer` (Singleton, extends OCSF `AbstractServer`) | One dispatch switch |
| `HSTSClient` + `ClientController` | Observer wiring, `Platform.runLater` handled once |

### Decisions made, and why

**OCSF given its own module.** The system description §11 asks for external
reuse. A separate module makes the borrowed framework visible at a glance and
guarantees we never edit it by accident.

**Only three OCSF classes copied in.** `AbstractClient`, `AbstractServer`,
`ConnectionToClient` — the three the submitted class diagram uses. The
`Adaptable*` / `Observable*` variants and the SimpleChat example were left out.

**OCSF converted from CR-only to LF, and protected by `.gitattributes`.** Verified
no content was lost: LF counts after conversion (352 / 460 / 291) exactly match
the CR counts before it.

**A launcher class that does not extend `Application`.** This is the single most
important line in either build. Naming an `Application` subclass as a jar's
Main-Class makes the JVM demand JavaFX on the *module* path; a fat jar has none,
so it refuses to start with *"JavaFX runtime components are missing"* — even
though JavaFX is inside that very jar. `ClientLauncher` / `ServerLauncher` exist
solely to sidestep that check.

**The repository root is `HSTS`, not `SE`.** The course staff's Hebrew documents
live in `SE` and must not be published to a public repository.

**Client has no database dependency.** Verified in the built artifact: the server
jar contains 1111 `com.mysql` classes, the client contains **zero**. The
three-tier separation is real, not just drawn.

### Problems hit, and how they were solved

**1. Maven could not find the JavaFX versions.**
*Symptom:* `'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.openjfx:javafx-base:jar is missing`.
*Cause:* Maven matches a dependency to its managed version by
groupId **+ artifactId + type + classifier** — all four. The parent declared the
JavaFX artifacts with `<classifier>win</classifier>`, the modules requested them
without one, so nothing matched.
*Fix:* repeat the classifier in each module's dependency block.

**2. MySQL refused to connect with a time-zone error.**
*Symptom:* `The server time zone value 'Jerusalem Daylight Time' is not recognized
or represents more than one time zone`.
*Cause:* `connectionTimeZone=SERVER` makes the driver ask MySQL which zone it is
in. On Windows, MySQL answers with a Windows zone name; Connector/J only
understands IANA names such as `Asia/Jerusalem`.
*Worth knowing:* this failure happens **after** the password has already been
accepted, so it looks like a login problem when it is not.
*Fix:* `connectionTimeZone=LOCAL` — use the JVM's own zone and never ask the
server. Correct here because MySQL always runs on the same machine as the server
program.

*(Both of these are candidates for the "describe a design or coding problem you
met" question the Assignment 3 Word document requires.)*

### Verified — by running it, not by assuming

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Four modules build | 0 errors |
| Jar names, manifests | `G1_Client.jar` → `hsts.client.ClientLauncher`; `G1_Server.jar` → `hsts.server.ServerLauncher` |
| JavaFX 26 fat jar launches on JDK 26 | yes — both jars |
| FXML loads from inside the packaged jar | yes |
| JavaFX native DLLs survive shading | 54 in each jar |
| `module-info.class` collisions | none |
| Database smoke test | **8 / 8 passed** — MySQL 8.0.46 |
| End-to-end client↔server↔database test | **14 / 14 passed** |
| OCSF survives a full git round trip | fresh clone byte-identical, and it builds |
| GUI round trip, clicked through by hand | **passed** — server startup window → console showing MySQL 8.0.46; client startup → Connect → PING → login as `teacher1` |

### Known minor issue

Server log prints `Client disconnected: null` on a clean disconnect. OCSF's
`ConnectionToClient.toString()` reads the socket address, which is already gone
by the time the hook runs. Cosmetic only — logged here so it is not mistaken for
a fault later.

### Still outstanding for milestone 1

- **Two-laptop test over the LAN**, including the Windows Firewall rule. Everything
  so far has run on one machine, where the network path is real TCP but never
  leaves the box. Until this is done, מתווה item 15 is not fully proven.

### Verdict

Milestone 1 achieved its purpose. The stack is proven on JDK 26 and no feature
work is blocked on unknown technology. The one remaining check needs a second
machine.

## Milestone 2 — login, roles and menus · 2026-07-29

**Covers:** SUC-1, מתווה scenario 1, requirements 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13.

### What was built

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SchemaManager` | The **full** 19-table schema from the plan, not just what milestone 2 needs |
| `SeedRunner` | 4 subjects, 8 courses, 53 users, ~160 enrolments |
| `UserDAO` + `IDAO` | DAO pattern; all user SQL in one class |
| `IUserManagementSystem` + `LocalUserManagementAdapter` | The boundary, and its local implementation |
| `SessionRegistry` | Single-session enforcement, and the foundation for server push |
| `LoginController` | SUC-1 |
| Entities | `User`, `Teacher`, `SubjectCoordinator`, `Student`, `Principal`, `Subject`, `Course`, `UserRole` |
| `IsraeliId` | Check-digit validation and generation |
| Client screens | `Login.fxml`, `MainMenu.fxml` and their controllers |

The milestone 1 scaffolding (`SkeletonCheck` screen, `m1_skeleton*` tables) was
deleted, not left lying around.

### Decisions made, and why

**The whole schema was created now, not just the users part.** Later milestones
add rows, not tables. Creating it once keeps the design in a single readable
file and means no milestone has to migrate anything.

**`ExamStatus` has no `IN_DRAWER` value.** As agreed: an exam is
`PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED` or `REJECTED`, and "in the drawer" is answered by
asking whether it has an open execution. The old enum could not describe an
approved-but-not-yet-released exam at all.

**Execution counts are not stored.** Requirement 48's started / finished /
timed-out numbers will be a `COUNT` over `student_exam`. A stored counter that
someone forgets to increment is a bug you discover at the demo; a `COUNT` is
right by construction.

**Login sessions live in memory, not in a database column.** A `logged_in` column
survives a crash or a closed laptop lid, and then that user can never log in
again without hand-editing the database. `SessionRegistry` is cleared by OCSF's
disconnect hook, and a server restart logs everyone out - which is the truth.

**The `User` object sent to the client has no password, hash or salt field.**
It crosses the network on every login, so anything on it is handed to the client.
The hash and salt are read inside `UserDAO`, compared there, and dropped. There
is a test that fails if a field with such a name is ever added.

**Failed logins say "Incorrect username or password" for both causes.** Naming
which one was wrong would let anyone discover valid usernames by trying them.
`UserDAO.verifyCredentials` also performs a hash computation when the username
does not exist, so a missing user takes about as long to reject as a wrong
password - otherwise the timing alone gives it away.

**The seeder is Java, not a `.sql` file.** Two reasons a script cannot meet.
Every user ID must pass the Israeli check-digit test now that a student types
hers before an exam - `123456789` is not a valid ID. And later milestones need an
exam open *at the moment of the demo*, so dates must be computed relative to when
the seeder runs, not hard-coded. Its random generator has a fixed seed, so the
data is identical on both laptops and on every run.

**Menu entries for unbuilt features are shown but disabled, labelled with their
milestone.** Hiding them would make the menu look finished when it is not.

### Verified — 48 automated checks, all passing

| Group | Result |
|---|---|
| All 19 tables created; milestone 1 scaffolding dropped | 20/20 |
| Seeding: 4 subjects, 8 courses, 53 users, enrolments | 4/4 |
| Re-seeding is a no-op (no duplicates) | 1/1 |
| **All 53 generated IDs pass the Israeli check digit** | 3/3 |
| 7 courses have two teachers (מתווה 13.3 needs at least one) | 1/1 |
| Each role logs in and arrives as the right Java subclass | 4/4 |
| **The `User` sent to the client carries no secrets** | 1/1 |
| Course and subject associations really loaded from the database | 5/5 |
| Wrong password and unknown user both refused, with identical wording | 3/3 |
| **Requirement 4: the same user cannot log in twice** | 3/3 |
| Logging out frees the account | 2/2 |
| A dropped connection frees the account too | 2/2 |

### Still outstanding

- The two-laptop LAN test, carried over from milestone 1.
- GUI click-through of the login and menu screens.
