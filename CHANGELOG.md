# HSTS — change log

Running record of every meaningful change: **what** changed, **why**, and **how**.
Kept so the project can be explained and defended at the demo.

## Milestone 1 — walking skeleton · 2026-07-29

**Goal:** prove that JavaFX + OCSF + MySQL + fat-jar packaging all work together
on JDK 26 *before* writing a single feature. No HSTS functionality is included
on purpose.

### What was built

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Four Maven modules | `hsts-ocsf`, `hsts-common`, `hsts-server`, `hsts-client` |
| `G1_Server.jar` (14.3 MB), `G1_Client.jar` (9.7 MB) | Names required by the Assignment 3 instructions |
| Server startup window + console screen | FXML; מתווה item 15 |
| Client startup window + skeleton check screen | FXML; מתווה item 15 |
| `Request` / `Response` / `Credentials` protocol envelope | Shared by both jars |
| `PasswordHasher` | Salted SHA-256 |
| `DBController` (Singleton) | Creates the database if absent |
| `HSTSServer` (Singleton, extends OCSF `AbstractServer`) | One dispatch switch |
| `HSTSClient` + `ClientController` | Observer wiring, `Platform.runLater` handled once |

### Decisions made, and why

**OCSF given its own module.** The system description §11 asks for external
reuse. A separate module makes the borrowed framework visible at a glance and
guarantees we never edit it by accident.

**Only three OCSF classes copied in.** `AbstractClient`, `AbstractServer`,
`ConnectionToClient` — the three the submitted class diagram uses. The
`Adaptable*` / `Observable*` variants and the SimpleChat example were left out.

**OCSF converted from CR-only to LF, and protected by `.gitattributes`.** Verified
no content was lost: LF counts after conversion (352 / 460 / 291) exactly match
the CR counts before it.

**A launcher class that does not extend `Application`.** This is the single most
important line in either build. Naming an `Application` subclass as a jar's
Main-Class makes the JVM demand JavaFX on the *module* path; a fat jar has none,
so it refuses to start with *"JavaFX runtime components are missing"* — even
though JavaFX is inside that very jar. `ClientLauncher` / `ServerLauncher` exist
solely to sidestep that check.

**The repository root is `HSTS`, not `SE`.** The course staff's Hebrew documents
live in `SE` and must not be published to a public repository.

**Client has no database dependency.** Verified in the built artifact: the server
jar contains 1111 `com.mysql` classes, the client contains **zero**. The
three-tier separation is real, not just drawn.

### Problems hit, and how they were solved

**1. Maven could not find the JavaFX versions.**
*Symptom:* `'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.openjfx:javafx-base:jar is missing`.
*Cause:* Maven matches a dependency to its managed version by
groupId **+ artifactId + type + classifier** — all four. The parent declared the
JavaFX artifacts with `<classifier>win</classifier>`, the modules requested them
without one, so nothing matched.
*Fix:* repeat the classifier in each module's dependency block.

**2. MySQL refused to connect with a time-zone error.**
*Symptom:* `The server time zone value 'Jerusalem Daylight Time' is not recognized
or represents more than one time zone`.
*Cause:* `connectionTimeZone=SERVER` makes the driver ask MySQL which zone it is
in. On Windows, MySQL answers with a Windows zone name; Connector/J only
understands IANA names such as `Asia/Jerusalem`.
*Worth knowing:* this failure happens **after** the password has already been
accepted, so it looks like a login problem when it is not.
*Fix:* `connectionTimeZone=LOCAL` — use the JVM's own zone and never ask the
server. Correct here because MySQL always runs on the same machine as the server
program.

*(Both of these are candidates for the "describe a design or coding problem you
met" question the Assignment 3 Word document requires.)*

### Verified — by running it, not by assuming

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Four modules build | 0 errors |
| Jar names, manifests | `G1_Client.jar` → `hsts.client.ClientLauncher`; `G1_Server.jar` → `hsts.server.ServerLauncher` |
| JavaFX 26 fat jar launches on JDK 26 | yes — both jars |
| FXML loads from inside the packaged jar | yes |
| JavaFX native DLLs survive shading | 54 in each jar |
| `module-info.class` collisions | none |
| Database smoke test | **8 / 8 passed** — MySQL 8.0.46 |
| End-to-end client↔server↔database test | **14 / 14 passed** |
| OCSF survives a full git round trip | fresh clone byte-identical, and it builds |
| GUI round trip, clicked through by hand | **passed** — server startup window → console showing MySQL 8.0.46; client startup → Connect → PING → login as `teacher1` |

### Known minor issue

Server log prints `Client disconnected: null` on a clean disconnect. OCSF's
`ConnectionToClient.toString()` reads the socket address, which is already gone
by the time the hook runs. Cosmetic only — logged here so it is not mistaken for
a fault later.

### Still outstanding for milestone 1

- **Two-laptop test over the LAN**, including the Windows Firewall rule. Everything
  so far has run on one machine, where the network path is real TCP but never
  leaves the box. Until this is done, מתווה item 15 is not fully proven.

### Verdict

Milestone 1 achieved its purpose. The stack is proven on JDK 26 and no feature
work is blocked on unknown technology. The one remaining check needs a second
machine.
